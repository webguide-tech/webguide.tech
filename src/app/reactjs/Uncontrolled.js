// ## Uncontrolled components ##
// - form data is handled by the HTML DOM
// - To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM.
// - less code, quick and dirty solution to implement forms
// - In React, an <input type="file" /> is always an uncontrolled component because its value can only be set by a user, and not programmatically.
